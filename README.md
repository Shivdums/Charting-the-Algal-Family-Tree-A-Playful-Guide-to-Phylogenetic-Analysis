The phylogenetic analysis of dinoflagellates' transcriptomic data reveals their evolutionary history and genetic diversity, shedding light on their adaptation to diverse environments. This understanding aids ecological conservation and biotechnological innovation.
The broader application of this protocol is emphasized in the context of marine organisms, where obtaining complete genome sequences for all species is often impractical. Large-scale phylogenetics using genome or transcriptome sequences has become a standard tool for studying evolutionary relationships in marine organisms, contributing essential insights into their diversity and evolutionary history.
Methodology in brief:
1. Obtained (mRNA) FASTA sequences of dinoflagellate organisms from NCBI.
2. Compiled sequences in a text editor (Notepad).
3. Ran the sequences through multiple sequence alignment (MSA) software to check for multiple sequences and ensure alignment.
4. Saved the aligned sequences as a .fasta file.
5. Utilized MEGA software to construct a phylogenetic tree.
6. The phylogenetic tree displayed branches representing evolutionary relationships among dinoflagellate species.
Result and Conclusions:
The files Above are of the Phylogenetic tree constructed on Dinoflagellate protists and u can observe the Relationship among the trees by the branch length and subtrees to understand who the common ancestors are.
Here is an detailed Analysis to understand the tree and the relationship of diff Dinoflagellates :
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the relationships shown in the tree:
Cryptoperidinium cohnii is the most distantly related dinoflagellate in this group.
Gymnodinium catenatum and Breviolum minutum are most closely related to each other than they are to any other dinoflagellate in the image.
Kryptoperidinium foliaceum and Perkinsus marinus are also closely related.
Alexandrium pacificum and Alexandrium affine are closely related.
Heterocapsa rotundata and TSA: Heterocapsa arctica are closely related.
Alexandrium minutum is closely related to Alexandrium pacificum and Alexandrium affine
Noctiluca scintillans and Oxyrrhis marina are distantly related to all the other dinoflagellates.
Note:
Shorter branches: Indicate closer evolutionary relationships between the species they connect. These species likely share a more recent common ancestor.
Longer branches: Suggest a more distant evolutionary relationship. These species diverged from their common ancestor further back in time.
Positioning of branches: Shows how different groups of dinoflagellates are related to each other. Species that cluster together on a branch likely share unique characteristics that aren't found in other dinoflagellates.
